Your goal in this assignment is to implement model ensembling.
The [mnist_ensemble.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/03/mnist_ensemble.py)
template trains `args.models` individual models, and your goal is to perform
an ensemble of the first model, first two models, first three models, â€¦, all
models, and evaluate their accuracy on the development set.

In addition to submitting the task in ReCodEx, run the script with
`args.models=7` and look at the results in `mnist_ensemble.out` file.
