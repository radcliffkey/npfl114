Solve the [CartPole-v1 environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1)
from the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), utilizing only provided supervised
training data. The data is available in
[gym_cartpole-data.txt](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/02/gym_cartpole-data.txt)
file, each line containing one observation (four space separated floats) and
a corresponding action (the last space separated integer). Start with the
[gym_cartpole.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/02/gym_cartpole.py).

The solution to this task should be a _model_ which passes evaluation on random
inputs. This evaluation is performed by running the
[gym_cartpole_evaluate.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/02/gym_cartpole_evaluate.py),
which loads a model and then evaluates it on 100 random episodes (optionally
rendering if `--render` option is provided). In order to pass, you must achieve
an average reward of at least 475 on 100 episodes. Your model should have either
one or two outputs (i.e., using either sigmoid of softmax output function).

_The size of the training data is very small and you should consider
it when designing the model._

When submitting your model to ReCodEx, submit:
- one file with the model itself (with `h5` suffix),
- the source code (or multiple sources) used to train the model (with `py` suffix),
  and possibly indicating teams.
